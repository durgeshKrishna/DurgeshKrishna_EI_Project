# Exercise 1 (Problem Statement on Design Patterns)

# BEHAVIOURAL DESIGN PATTERN

## 1) News Agency - Observer Pattern üì∞
   
This project is a Java implementation of the **Observer Design Pattern**. It demonstrates how an object (the **Subject**) can notify a list of dependent objects (the **Observers**) automatically when its state changes, promoting loose coupling.

The use case simulates a news agency that distributes news to multiple subscribers. When the agency publishes a new story, all registered subscribers are notified instantly and automatically, ensuring they receive the latest updates without having to poll the agency.

#### Implementation Details

* **`Subject` (Interface):** Defines the contract for the object being observed, with methods to attach, detach, and notify observers.
* **`Observer` (Interface):** Defines the contract for subscribers, with an `update()` method that the Subject calls during notification.
* **`NewsAgency` (Class):** The concrete **Subject**. It maintains a list of `Observer`s and triggers notifications when new news is published via its `setNews()` method.
* **`Subscriber` (Class):** The concrete **Observer**. It implements the `update()` method to handle the notification (e.g., printing the news received).
* **`ObserverPattern` (Class):** The entry point that wires everything together and demonstrates the notification flow.

## 2) E-commerce Payment System - Strategy Pattern üí≥

This project is an implementation of the **Strategy Design Pattern**. It defines a family of algorithms (payment methods), encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

The use case demonstrates a payment processing system for an e-commerce platform. It allows a user to select from various payment methods (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal, UPI) at checkout. The system processes the payment using the selected method without changing the core checkout logic.

#### Implementation Details

* **`PaymentStrategy` (Interface):** The **Strategy** interface that declares the common `pay()` operation for all supported payment algorithms.
* **`CreditCardPayment`, `PayPalPayment` & `UPIPayment` (Classes):** The concrete **Strategies**. Each one implements the `pay()` method with a specific payment algorithm.
* **`PaymentContext` (Class):** The **Context** that holds a reference to a payment strategy object. It delegates the payment task to the current strategy, remaining independent of the actual algorithm used.
* **`StrategyPattern` (Class):** The entry point that creates and assigns different strategies to the context to show the dynamic behavior.

# CREATIONAL DESIGN PATTERN

## 1) Database Connection Manager - Singleton Pattern üîó

This project demonstrates the **Singleton Design Pattern**. This creational pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that single instance.

The use case simulates a system that requires a single, globally accessible point for database connections. To conserve resources and ensure a consistent connection state, the application must guarantee that only one instance of the database connection object is ever created.

#### Implementation Details

* **`DatabaseConnection` (Class):** The **Singleton** class. It features a `private` constructor to prevent direct instantiation and a `public static getInstance()` method that controls access to the single instance using double-checked locking for thread safety.
* **`SingletonPattern` (Class):** The client code that retrieves the singleton instance multiple times and verifies that all references point to the exact same object.

## 2) Notification Service - Factory Pattern üìß

This project is a classic implementation of the **Factory Method Design Pattern**. This creational pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

The use case features a notification service that can send different types of notifications, such as Email and SMS. The client code that requests a notification doesn't need to know the specific details of how each notification object is created.

#### Implementation Details

* **`Notification` (Interface):** The **Product** interface, which defines the common methods for all concrete notification types.
* **`EmailNotification` & `SMSNotification` (Classes):** The **Concrete Products** that implement the `Notification` interface.
* **`NotificationFactory` (Abstract Class):** The **Creator**. It contains the abstract `createNotification()` factory method.
* **`EmailNotificationFactory` & `SMSNotificationFactory` (Classes):** The **Concrete Creators**. Each class overrides the `createNotification()` method to produce and return a specific type of notification.
* **`FactoryPattern` (Class):** The client code that uses the factories to create and send notifications.

# STRUCTURAL DESIGN PATTERN

## 1) Car Dealership System - Adapter Pattern üöó

This project demonstrates the **Adapter Design Pattern**. This structural pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting the interface of a class into another interface a client expects.

The use case features a car dealership's software system designed to work with `Car` objects that have specific methods (`getName`, `getBrand`, `getPrice`). The dealership starts sourcing foreign cars, but the data for these cars comes from a `ForeignCar` class with a different interface (`getCarName`, `getCarBrand`, `getBrandPrice`). The adapter makes this integration possible without changing the existing code.

#### Implementation Details

* **`Car` (Interface):** The **Target Interface**. This is the interface that the client system expects to use for displaying car information.
* **`IndianCar` (Class):** An existing class that already conforms to the `Car` interface.
* **`ForeignCar` (Class):** The **Adaptee**. This is the existing class with an incompatible interface that we need to integrate into our system.
* **`ForeignCarAdapter` (Class):** The **Adapter**. This class implements the `Car` interface and internally wraps an instance of the `ForeignCar`, translating calls from the target interface to the adaptee's interface.
* **`CarDealerClient` (Class):** The client class that works with objects of the `Car` interface.
* **`AdapterPattern` (Class):** The entry point that demonstrates how the adapter allows the client to work with both car types seamlessly.

## 2) Tea Shop Customizer - Decorator Pattern üçµ

This project demonstrates the **Decorator Design Pattern**. This structural pattern allows you to attach new behaviors to objects dynamically by placing them inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

The use case models a tea shop where customers can customize their drinks. A customer starts with a `SimpleTea` and can dynamically add extra ingredients like Masala, Ginger, or Cardamom. Each addition modifies the final description and price of the tea, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

#### Implementation Details

* **`Tea` (Interface):** The **Component**. This is the common interface for both the base object (the tea) and the decorators (the extras).
* **`SimpleTea` (Class):** The **Concrete Component**. This is the basic object that we will dynamically add responsibilities to.
* **`TeaDecorator` (Abstract Class):** The base **Decorator**. It implements the `Tea` interface and holds a reference to a `Tea` object, which it "wraps".
* **`MasalaTeaDecorator`, `GingerTeaDecorator` & `CardamomTeaDecorator` (Classes):** The **Concrete Decorators**. These classes extend the base decorator and add their own functionality (cost and description) to the wrapped object.
* **`DecoratorPattern` (Class):** The client code that assembles the tea order by wrapping a simple tea with multiple decorators.

# Exercise 2
# Smart Home System üè†

## Overview
This is a Java-based console application that simulates the backend of a smart home environment. It allows users to manage and control various smart devices (lights, door locks, thermostats) through a central hub. The system supports scheduling device operations, automating tasks with triggers, grouping devices for simultaneous control, and viewing system logs.

## Core Features
* **Device Management:** Add, remove, and control individual smart devices (lights, door locks, thermostats).

* **Scheduling:** Set commands for devices to execute at a specified time.

* **Automation:** Create triggers that perform an action when a condition is met (e.g., turn on lights when temperature drops).

* **Group Control:** Create groups of devices to turn them all on or off with a single command.

* **Status Reporting:** View the current status of all connected devices in the system.

* **System Logging:** View a comprehensive log of all actions performed in the system.

## Technical Design

### Design Patterns Used

* **Factory Method Pattern:** The `DeviceFactory` creates instances of various device types (`Light`, `DoorLock`, `Thermostat`) without exposing the instantiation logic to the client. This decouples the `SmartHomeHub` from concrete device classes, making the system easily extensible with new device types.

* **Proxy Pattern:** Every device added to the `SmartHomeHub` is wrapped in a `DeviceProxy`. This controls access to the real device and can be extended to add features like logging, permission checks, or lazy loading without modifying the device's code.

* **Observer Pattern:** The structure is in place for devices to be updated on system changes. Each `Device` implements the `DeviceObserver` interface, allowing it to receive updates and react accordingly (e.g., the Thermostat checking its temperature).

* **Command Pattern (Implicit):** `Schedule` and `Trigger` objects encapsulate a request (e.g., "turn on device 1") and its context (time or condition). The `SmartHomeHub` stores and manages these command objects, decoupling the request from the immediate execution logic.

### SOLID Principles

* **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each class has one clear responsibility. The `SmartHomeHub` manages devices, `DeviceFactory` creates devices, and individual device classes handle their own state.

* **Open/Closed Principle:** The system is open for extension but closed for modification. New device types can be added by creating new classes that extend `Device` without altering existing code.

* **Liskov Substitution Principle:** All device types can be substituted for the base `Device` class without breaking functionality.

* **Interface Segregation Principle:** Interfaces are kept focused and specific (e.g., `DeviceObserver` only contains update methods).

* **Dependency Inversion Principle:** High-level modules (like `SmartHomeHub`) depend on abstractions (`Device` interface) rather than concrete implementations.

## Classes and Their Responsibilities

* **`Device.java`:** Abstract base class defining common properties and methods for all devices; implements the `DeviceObserver` interface.

* **`Light.java`:** Concrete implementation of `Device` for light devices with on/off functionality.

* **`Thermostat.java`:** Concrete implementation of `Device` for thermostat devices with temperature control.

* **`DoorLock.java`:** Concrete implementation of `Device` for door lock devices with lock/unlock functionality.

* **`DeviceFactory.java`:** Factory class for creating various device instances based on type string input.

* **`DeviceProxy.java`:** Proxy class that wraps around real devices to control access and add cross-cutting concerns.

* **`DeviceObserver.java`:** The observer interface for device status updates and system notifications.

* **`SmartHomeHub.java`:** The central hub for managing all devices, schedules, triggers, and groups.

* **`Schedule.java`:** Represents scheduling information for a device command with time-based execution.

* **`Trigger.java`:** Represents a trigger that automates a device action based on specific conditions.

* **`DeviceGroup.java`:** Represents a collection of devices that can be controlled together as a unit.

* **`Main.java`:** The entry point of the application for handling all user interaction and menu navigation.
